# Node.js Exercises

## Date: 10/14/19 W8 D1 D33

### Summary

Today was mainly focused on completing exercises utilizing node.js. We learned about the package.json file that gets created when running `npm init`.

We used the npm module pg-promises which enables a link between node.js and a postgres database.

One of my takeaways from today is to never make an edit to a third-party node module because that can introduce unique behavior when collaborating in a team.
